          The very first computer mouse was created by Douglas Engelbart in
          1964, and it was made for the PC age. It was a wooden box with two
          wheels that made contact with the surface and it only had one button.
          Douglas Engelbart of SRI was part of an experiment conducted by DARPA
          to develop a better way to interact with computers. DARPA's creation
          of the mouse was among the first innovations that would help shape the
          future of information technology. Over the next five decades, the
          company would play a leading role in developing new technologies.

          Douglas Carl Engelbart, born on January 30th in 1925, was an engineer
          and an early Internet pioneer. He was most known for his work on the
          field of human-computer interaction, which led to the creation of the
          computer mouse and the development of various graphical user
          interfaces. The Augmentation Research Center's NLS, which was headed
          by Engelbart, showed numerous technologies, some of which are now
          widely used. It was acquired by McDonnell Douglas from SRI in 1984 and
          was renamed the Doug Engelbart institute. In 1988, Doug Engelbart and
          Christina founded The Doug Engelbart Institute to promote his vision.
          Their effort resulted in DARPA funding to update the UI of Augment.

          He was the middle child in a family of three children. His father died
          when he was 8 years old. He graduated from high school in 1942. He
          spent two years in the Navy in the Philippines. While stationed there,
          he was inspired by Vannevar Bush's book "As We May Think." He studied
          electrical engineering at Oregon State. He got his master's degree at
          Oregon State University before getting a job at the Ames Research
          Center. There, he met Ballard Fish, who was just completing her
          occupational therapy training. They were married on May 5, 1951, at
          Portola State Park. Engelbart pursued graduate studies at UC Berkeley
          before going back to Ames.

          Most of the mice before the optical mouse were made with balls als a
          way of moving the mouse on screen. This mouse is the first mouse to
          use light as a guiding source, this made the mouse dustproof. However
          the mouse needed a mouse pad with it which was most likely expensive.
          It was made by Steven Kirsch in 1981.

          The Apple Lisa mouse was one of the first commercially available mice.
          It was based on the Alto computer's original design and features a
          steel ball instead of the usual rubber. Though it was developed by
          Apple, the exact design and development of the device were handled by
          an outside firm called Hovey-Kelley. They built hundreds of prototypes
          and tested extensively with focus groups before finally producing the
          perfect device. The design and development of the mouse were done
          in-house by Bill Dresselhaus. The original case design was based on
          Art Deco lines and had a rounded shape.

        How Ball Mice Work
      </h2>

        <img
        src=https://cdn.glitch.me/474b7410-7e7e-4407-ab9e-c89b1a559243%2Fguyhesf.png?v=1633442260046>
        <p>
          The mouse works by moving it across the surface of your desk, the ball
          rolls using the weight of the mouse and your hand and the ball pushes
          against two rollers which are number 6 and 7 on the picture. Number 6
          detects whether the mouse is moving from left to right, somewhat like
          the x-axis on a graph, and number 7 detects whether the mouse is
          moving up and down, somewhat like the y-axis on a graph. Inside the
          mouse is a microchip that reads how many times a light beam is broken
          within part number 6 and 7. When the mouse is moved from left to
          right, top to bottom or in a diagonal diretion, both of the parts
          number 6 and 7 start moving around their own axis. This is how the
          light breaking works. Both part 6 and 7 have holes in the big circle
          which let through light and also block them. This is how the microchip
          on the inside of the mouse is able to read how far and in what
          direction the mouse is moving or has been moved. There are however a
          couple of problems with this kind of mouse. First off it's not dirt
          proof which could lead to the holes in the parts number 6 and 7 being
          filled with dirt, leading to choppy movements of the mouse. The other
          one is that you need either a special mouse mat or a very flat surface
          otherwise the ball won't roll.

        How Optical Mice Work
      </h2>

        src=https://cdn.glitch.me/474b7410-7e7e-4407-ab9e-c89b1a559243%2Fguyeagasegasegae.png?v=1633443474962>
        <p>
          The optical mouse works by shining a light down on the desk using a
          LED. The light produced form the LED shines down onto the desk and the
          desk reflects it back up to the mouse, into a photocell. The photocell
          has a built in lens that magnifies the reflected light, that way the
          chip inside the mouse is able to read the movements you make with the
          mouse more precisely. By moving the mouse around the light reflections
          change and that is how the chip is able to figure out where you hand
          is moving the mouse. Most optical mice have a wheel in the front
          middle so you're able to scroll through websites much faster and
          you're also able to push it in, like a button. This wheel basically
          replaces the middle button on a conventional ball mouse. The one
          drawback this kind of mouse has is that if the lens inside the
          photocell is dirty the chip might not be able to read the reflections
          that well and it might hinder how the mouse moves on screen.

        The Invention Of The Touchpad

        <p>
          A touch pad is a device that's used for controlling the input position
          of a computer screen. It is usually made to work seamlessly with
          desktop computers. The very first commercially available touch pad was
          created by George E. Gerpheide in 1988. The top layer of the touch pad
          contains the material that you touch. Beneath it is a circuit board
          that contains the rows and layers of electrodes that are connected to
          a grid. When the finger touches the grid, the current is interrupted,
          and the circuit board interprets the interruption. This interruption
          would be read by a microchip and then the microchip would know where
          to move the onscreen mouse to.

        Link with Robot

        <p>
          The link between the mouse and my robot is hard to make. They're both completely different things 
          however they have some things in common. Both are very easy to use, a standard mouse just has 2 buttons 
          and one scroll wheel, which is very easy to understand. My robot just has one button to turn it on and off again 
          which is also very easy to understand. Both my robot and the mouse have had some upgrades with time, like how the 
          mouse went from a ball mouse to infrared / optical and my robot went from not working to working. 
          As a comparison i would like to say that my robot glides over the battlefield like a mouse glides over a mousemat. 
          As for my other robot (which i don't have a picture of), it was also very easy to use like the mouse. A patient would 
          press the button for help and a doctor or nurse would hear a sound and see red lights, the doctor or nurse would then press 
          a button on their side so the patient would know someone is coming to help. As for a link i would say that the mouse and help button 
          are both a revolutionary invention to help people with daily life.
